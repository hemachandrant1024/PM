                <h2>About Pawfect Match</h2>
                <p>Pawfect match is a non-profit organization started by a small group of animal lovers in Chennai, who have
                    had enough of seeing innocent animals struggle for their lives.
                    <br>
                    We help animals in distress (orphaned, injured or abandoned) and find loving homes that treat them
                    like family.

                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p>Pawfect Match’s primary mission is to find forever loving families and homes for animals in need.

                    We home/rehome orphaned, abandoned, homeless cats & dogs from the streets after providing them with
                    state-of-the-art private medical care to ensure a hassle-free experience and life for the adopters
                    as well as the pet.</p>
            
            
            <ul><h2>In Addition</h2>
                <li>We get community street dogs sterilized to keep the population in check</li>
                <li>Educate adopter families on the importance of sterilization</li>
                <li>Feed stray dogs in the neighbouring areas</li>
                <li>Regularly follow-up with adopters to ensure the well-being of the pet adopted from Pawfect Match</li>
                <li>Treat injured animals and release them back into their territories. If we they cannot survive on
                    their own, we get them adopted.</li>
                <li>Facilitate rehoming and adoption of animals in areas of low adoption rates/chances</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pawfect Match’s team has independently homed 700+ Pups, Kittens and Dogs in the last 4 years, including several
                blind/deaf kittens and handicapped dogs. We also closely work with other pet adoption groups to help
                them with their adoption activities.</p>

                express the satisfaction and contentment we get when a pet gets adopted and grows with the family with
